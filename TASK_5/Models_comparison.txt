1. Comparison in Qlib Models
Best Performing Models (Alpha158):

**DoubleEnsemble:**
- AR: 0.1158 (11.58% yearly return)
- IR: 1.3432 (excellent risk-adjusted return)

**LightGBM:**
- AR: 0.0901 (9.01% yearly return)
- IR: 1.0164 (excellent risk-adjusted return)

**MLP:**
- AR: 0.0895 (8.95% yearly return)
- IR: 1.1408 (excellent risk-adjusted return)

**Why Both Metrics Matter:**

- AR alone doesn't consider risk
- Higher AR might come with higher risk
- Doesn't tell you about consistency
- IR considers both return and risk
- Shows how much return you get per unit of risk
- Better for comparing strategies

**Together they provide:**
- AR: Absolute performance measure
- IR: Risk-adjusted performance measure

2. Usage in Model Selection

**Risk Tolerance:**
- High risk tolerance: Focus on AR
- Low risk tolerance: Focus on IR

**Investment Goals:**
- Maximum returns: Look at AR
- Stable returns: Look at IR

**Best Practice:**
- Consider both metrics together
- High AR + High IR = Ideal model

**Example:** DoubleEnsemble (High AR and IR)
