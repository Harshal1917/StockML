1.IC (Information Coefficient): Measures correlation between predicted returns and actual returns. Higher is better.
2.ICIR (Information Coefficient Information Ratio): IC divided by its standard deviation. Shows prediction consistency.
3.Annualized Return: The yearly return generated by the model's predictions.
4.Information Ratio: Risk-adjusted return measure - excess return divided by tracking error. Higher is better.
5.Max Drawdown: Largest drop from peak to trough. Lower (less negative) is better.
