### Alpha158
- **Description**: A tabular dataset with carefully engineered features designed by human experts.
- **Features Include**:
  - Basic price/volume features
  - Technical indicators
  - Rolling statistics (mean, standard deviation, correlation, etc.)
- **Total Alpha Factors**: 158

#### Key Characteristics:
- Less spatial relationships between different features due to independent engineering.
- Features are normalized and processed to remove unit effects.
- Includes various technical indicators such as:
  - ROC (Rate of Change)
  - MA (Moving Average)
  - STD (Standard Deviation)
  - BETA (Price change rate)
  - RSI-like indicators
  - Volume-based indicators
  - And many more.

### Alpha360
- **Description**: A dataset focused on raw price and volume data with minimal feature engineering.
- **Includes**:
  - Historical price data (open, high, low, close)
  - Volume data
- **Data Span**: 60 days of history
- **Total Features**: 360 derived from raw inputs.

#### Key Characteristics:
- Strong spatial relationships between features in the time dimension.
- Features are normalized by the latest price and volume data.
- More suitable for models that can learn temporal patterns (like neural networks).

#### Raw Data Includes:
- Normalized closing prices
- Normalized opening prices
- Normalized high prices
- Normalized low prices
- Normalized volume
- VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)
